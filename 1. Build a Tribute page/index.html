                    <p>

                        Created
                        by
                        David Shore and portrayed by English actor Hugh Laurie, he leads a team of diagnosticians as the
                        Head of
                        Diagnostic Medicine at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in Princeton, New

                    <h2>Personality</h2>
                    <p>
                        House frequently shows off his cunning and biting wit, and enjoys picking people apart and
                        mocking
                        their
                        weaknesses, House accurately deduces people's motives and histories from aspects of their
                        personality, appearance, and behavior His friend and colleague Wilson says that while some
                        doctors
                        have the "Messiah complex" (they need to "save the world"), House has the "Rubik's complex" (he
                        needs to
                        "solve the puzzle").
