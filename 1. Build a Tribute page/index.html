            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              Dr. Gregory House, M.D. is the title character of the American
              medical drama series House. Created by David Shore and portrayed
              by English actor Hugh Laurie, he leads a team of diagnosticians as
              the Head of Diagnostic Medicine at the fictional
              Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in Princeton, New Jersey.

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
              House frequently shows off his cunning and biting wit, and enjoys
              picking people apart and mocking their weaknesses, House
              accurately deduces people's motives and histories from aspects of
              their personality, appearance, and behavior His friend and
              colleague Wilson says that while some doctors have the "Messiah
              complex" (they need to "save the world"), House has the "Rubik's
              complex" (he needs to "solve the puzzle").
